                    <p>Hello, my name is William Rodriguez Cortez and I'm from El Salvador, I moved to the United States around 2 years ago. Some of the things I like are
                        cats, hearing music, and coding. Something I also enjoy is making something unique just like this website.
                    </p>
                    <h2>What I've been up to recently</h2>
                    <p>Recently I've been doing the Nextech Catapult program, a summer internship that consists of
                        teaching the younger generation coding skills that will be useful for later on in their coding
                        career, outside of that I also decided to take summer classes so now I'm doing AP Government & Politics and
                        AP Macroeconomics.</p>

                <p class="text looking-cool-one">As previously stated, I moved to the United States at around 2 years ago and it has changed who I am,
                    Before whenever someone would ask me what I wanted to do with my life I would answer I don't know;
                    It would overwhelm me to think of what I have to do for my future, However now that I moved from that mentality I have something to say,
                    I tend to get scared of what is next on my life but it doesn't stop me now. Being in the US has allowed me to find who I am and
                    what it means to live your life. I have many stories I could talk about it would go until the <strong id="blue">blue</strong> sky turned gray.
                    If you wish to talk more with me look for my contact information below.

But something I overlooked by accident is just how much I enjoy having a twin.
                While at times it can get annoying, its honestly something i that also makes me unique. I left some clips I've done with my twin on this part because its symbolic for me in a way, before I saw those memories as foggy because of them being made with him,
                but now that I start to appreciate who he is on my life those colorless memories have color now.
