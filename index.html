                    <h2>Who am I?</h2>
                    <p>Hello my name is William Rodriguez Cortez. I moved to the United States around 2 years ago,
                        something that has truly changed my life. I love cats and I've found many things I enjoy such as
                        music and coding. </p>
                    <h2>What I've been up to recently</h2>
                    <p>Recently I've been doing the Nextech Catapult program, a summer internship that consists of
                        teaching the younger generation coding skills that will be useful for later on in their coding
                        career, outside of that I also decided to take summer classes so now I'm doing AP Government and
                        AP Macroeconomics</p>

                    will be able to see what each color means.</p>

                <h2>Biography abt my life</h2>
                <p>As previously stated, I moved to the United States at around 2 years ago and it has changed who I am,
                    Before whenever someone would ask me what I wanted to do with my life I would answer I don't know;
                    However now that I moved from that mentality I have something to say, I tend to get scared of what
                    is next on my life but it doesn't stop me now. Being in the US has allowed me to find who I am and
                    what it means to live your life. I have many stories I would talk about, and for that you can
                    contact me in the contact information page</p>

                <h2>Education</h2>
                <p>I'm a Rising Senior at Pike High School trying to pursue the Academic Honors Diploma and possibly
                    getting a higher ranking on my year. I'm planning to get into Purdue Indianapolis to get a bacchelor
                    degree in Computer Science. It will be challenging because of my background, however I don't intend
                    to give up on this dream.</p>

                    me some other coding languages such as Block based coding, Python, SQL, and soon I'll learn Java</p>
